"""Instant call answers from the precomputed scene script (no model round-trip).

data/feeds/seville_scene_script.json holds, for every second of the demo
clip: the active camera, people visible (YOLO), weapons in view (dataset
hand labels) and Qwen3-VL descriptions of the armed people. The dispatcher's
usual questions (who are you, where, how many, weapons, descriptions,
injuries, location, movement) are answered from the second the wall is
showing, so the answer is immediate and matches the picture.
