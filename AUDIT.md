# AUDIT.md — Sentinel AI vs target architecture
Last audited: 2026-09-24 (ayush). Evidence from code reads + ZGX runtime checks.

## Challenges to the task prompt (do not treat as bugs)
1. **Hero demo is WEAPON (Seville chase), not medical/fall.** Contract divert 2026-09-24 in `context.md`. Priority item “C5 because VadCLIP has no fall class / medical hero” is **outdated**. Pose rule `fall` still exists for MEDICAL-ish posture; wire class for the demo is **WEAPON**.
2. **Severity outcomes** in code are `NONE | MINOR | SEVERE` (two thresholds), not exactly “severe+confident / severe+unsure / minor”. Close enough; don’t invent a third fuse axis without a group decision.
3. **Location from Completion B** would violate the invariant “location only from camera_map”. D6 implemented as **person description only**; address stays map-authored.
4. **`unknowns` on CallBrief** would be a `contracts/` change — deferred. Voice script already refuses breathing/pulse/injuries; helper `unknowns_for_voice()` documents the list without schema bump.

## Critical checks (done first)
| Check | Result | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| YOLO is POSE variant | **PASS** | `yolo26s-pose.pt` → Ultralytics `task=pose`, `kpt_shape=[17,3]` |
| Confidence from LOGPROBS | **PASS (partial)** | `ZRTClient` requests `logprobs:true`; `_parse_class_token` reads `logprobs.content[0].logprob`; `logprob_to_prob` → fuse. **Not** a model-written confidence field. Missing: held-out temperature calibration curve (uses raw exp). |

## Table

| A1 Clip store | Partial | Listed `campus_sentinel_media/feeds/` Seville 3 + ambient 3 (~18MB). Not 12 full wall clips. | INTENTIONAL short-term / MISSED for “12” | Left; need Naman 12-pack later |

## What we fixed this pass
1. **D6** Completion B (`describe`) → fills `person_description` for the call.
2. **A3** camera_map: floor, cross_streets, vehicle_access, neighbors+bearings.
3. **A2** `data/scenario.json` demo timeline.
4. **E4** guardrails (kill switch, one dispatch/incident, hourly cap) on SEVERE voice.
5. **fusion.py** Mac import break repaired.
6. Call brief speaks richer map logistics without contract change.

## What we did not / could not
- Full MediaMTX / NVDEC / 12-cam pack / Twilio+Parakeet+Kokoro / OSNet weights / LoRA / officer map prediction / temperature calibration fit.
- Raising Qwen GPU fraction (forbidden — coexistence).
- Splitting into five containers (intentional).

## Need from the team
- **Naman:** real ambient/12 clips + confirm scenario timings against Seville peek.
- **Pratham:** optional TRT YOLO again with Qwen at **0.40** (not 0.55); fix VadCLIP “random init” warning if real.
- **Indraneel:** wire officer UI to live Completion B person text + tool calls; next-cam prediction when OSNet lands.
- **Group:** ack CallBrief `unknowns` field if you want it on the wire contract.
